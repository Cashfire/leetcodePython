# There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
# 
# Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 
# you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
# 
# Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs,
#  is it possible for you to finish all courses?
# 
# For example:
# 
# 2, [[1,0]]
# There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 
# you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
# 
# 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
# There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have 
# finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

# Hints:
# This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. 
# If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.
# There are several ways to represent a graph. For example, the input prerequisites is a graph represented by
#  a list of edges. Is this graph representation appropriate?
# Topological Sort via DFS - A great video tutorial (21 minutes) on Coursera explaining the basic concepts
#  of Topological Sort.
# Topological sort could also be done via BFS.
